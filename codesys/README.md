# A deep dive into Reversing Codesys

This repo contains all the material accompanying our [published paper about
reverse engineering the Codesys V3 PLC runtime](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/02/14/a-deep-dive-into-reversing-codesys).

The different folders contain various scripts that aid in reverse engineering
the Codesys rutime or parse the Codesys network protocol. Every subfolder
contains a `README.md` file that contains a more in-depth description and usage
examples.
